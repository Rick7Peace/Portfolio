        I have always been passionate about technology and I'm excited to take on new challenges in the world of coding. I currently serve as the Board President of my HDFC building. This responsibility taught me how to work collaboratively with others. This skill set has been a vital part of my coding practice, as I have had to work in various teams. I have learned how to divide tasks based on individual skill sets and how to manage team work and group dynamics.

        When I'm not immersed in the world of coding, I love exploring New York City via bicycle rides, or taking walks with my dog. I like to find unique and hidden gems of the city and document my adventures through photography. In my free time, I also enjoy watching sci-fi movies, listening to music and playing video games. A dream of mine would be to create my own superhero themed video game or app.

      {/* Paragraph expressing values and goals */}
      <p className='text-center text-2xl text-black mb-5 pl-70 pr-70'>
        I take great pride in creating balanceâ€” both in my professional life and my personal life. My goal is to live a fulfilling, fun and adventurous life!
